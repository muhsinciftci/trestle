## Hello!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt School of Economics. My research interests are macroeconomics and applied econometrics. I am also interested in the application of machine learning to economics and how alternative ways can change the ways we understand the data.
  
Before joining Goethe University Frankfurt, I received a Master of Science in Economics from Middle East Technical University and at the same time, I worked as a researcher at the Central Bank of Turkey. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Bogazici University.
