My research interests are macroeconomics and applied econometrics. I am also interested in the application of machine learning to economics and how alternative ways can change the ways we understand the data.\nBefore joining Goethe University Frankfurt, I received a Master of Science in Economics from Middle East Technical University and at the same time, I worked as a researcher at the Central Bank of Turkey. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Bogazici University.\n\n\n Interests \nMacroeconomics\nApplied Econometrics\nMachine Learning\n\n\n Education \n\nPhD in Economics, 2019 - Present \nGoethe University Frankfurt, Germany\n\n\n\nMSc in Economics, 2017 - 2019 \nMiddle East Technical University, Turkey\n\n\n\nBA in Economics, 2010 - 2015 \nBogazici University, Turkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Muhsin Ciftci, 2022.
